This is a sample ground-up solution to the developer exercise used for 
SilverStripe Australia. If you are a candidate, feel free to take this and use
it as a basis of your own response - after all, it is an open source framework
of sorts! Remember though, you are being evaluated on how well you demonstrate
your understanding and capabilities, and any subsequent interview will take
your response into account. 

This is NOT meant to be an example of the best solution to the problem. It is
a 3 hour solution that is just meant to give an outline of what we are looking
for.

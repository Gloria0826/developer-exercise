This repository contains 2 sample solutions to the 
[Symbiote Developer Exercise](overview.md) that we use as part of our technical
hiring roles. 

If you are interested in submitting a response, please read the overview linked above,
and send a github link to jobs@symbiote.com.au

You are being evaluated on how well you demonstrate your understanding of code, 
so we're not expecting too much in the way if visual presentation. 

The two solutions in this repository are _not_ meant to be an example of the 
best solution to the problem, but to provide a guideline to what the bare minumum
functional solution should provide - think of them as the low bar. 

If you have stumbled across this, and are looking for a job, see the 
'overview' file contained within and have a go, then send an email to 
jobs@symbiote.com.au
